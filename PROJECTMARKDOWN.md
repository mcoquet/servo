Sure, I can help you define a structured dialect that would help communicate your project's file structure and its contents. Let's call this dialect "Project Markdown" (PM).

### Structure

In PM, we describe the project's structure in a hierarchical manner, beginning with the root directory, followed by its subdirectories, and the files within those directories.

1. **Directories:** Start the line with the directory name, followed by a slash (/).
2. **Files:** Indicate files by their full name, including extension. Files go under their respective directories, indented by two spaces.

### File Contents

For describing the contents of each file, we use an indented block under the file's name. We can include classes, methods, properties, and so forth, using a simplified pseudocode style.

1. **Classes:** Start with the keyword `class`, followed by the class name.
2. **Methods:** Use the keyword `def` (short for "define"), followed by the method's name and its parameters in parentheses.
3. **Properties:** Just list the property's name.

Here's a basic example of PM:

```
root/
  subdirectory1/
    File1.js
      class MyClass1
        property1
        property2
        def method1(param1, param2)
        def method2()
  subdirectory2/
    File2.js
      class MyClass2
        property3
        def method3(param3)
```
