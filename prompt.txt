Previously, we discussed the open-source JavaScript framework for building AI-driven agents with components such as Agents, Models, Plugins, and Interfaces. We created typings.
Here are the key classes:

BaseModel: Base class for AI models
OpenaiGPTModel: Class for interacting with OpenAI GPT models
BasePlugin: Base class for plugins that interact with the outside world
FilesystemPlugin: Class for interacting with the file system
BaseInterface: Base class for creating different types of interfaces
CLIInterface: Class for creating a CLI interface based on the BaseInterface class
BaseAgent: Base class for creating agents that use models, plugins, and interfaces for a cohesive purpose
The directory structure is:
