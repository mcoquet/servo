Previously, we discussed the open-source JavaScript framework for building AI-driven agents with components such as Agents, Models, Plugins, and Interfaces. We created typings for several classes, including BaseModel, OpenaiGPTModel, BasePlugin, and FilesystemPlugin. Additionally, we developed a BaseInterface class and created a test suite for it using Jest.

In this session, we built a CLIInterface class based on the BaseInterface class, using the enquirer package for handling user input and output. We created a Jest test suite for the CLIInterface class, mocking the enquirer package to prevent the actual prompt from appearing during tests.

Here are the key classes:

BaseModel: Base class for AI models
OpenaiGPTModel: Class for interacting with OpenAI GPT models
BasePlugin: Base class for plugins that interact with the outside world
FilesystemPlugin: Class for interacting with the file system
BaseInterface: Base class for creating different types of interfaces
CLIInterface: Class for creating a CLI interface based on the BaseInterface class

The directory structure is:
